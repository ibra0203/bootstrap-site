                <p><i>"Climate change is a change in the usual weather found in a place. This could be a change in how much rain a place usually gets in a year. Or it could be a change in a place's usual temperature for a month or season.

                Climate change is also a change in Earth's climate. This could be a change in Earth's usual temperature. Or it could be a change in where rain and snow usually fall on Earth.

                Weather can change in just a few hours. Climate takes hundreds or even millions of years to change."</i> -NASA</p>
